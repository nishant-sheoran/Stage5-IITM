# RISC-V 5-Stage Pipelined Simulator

This is a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V Simulator written in Python.

This is a project for the NYU MSCE Computing Systems Architecture (CSA) course.

## Key Points to Know for Grading But Not Mentioned in the Provided Document

1.	State Results:
- State results are **not graded**.
- Variations in implementation logic can cause differences in state results, which is fine.
2. Grading Criteria:
- Focus on Register File (RF) and Data Memory (DMEM) files; they must match test cases exactly.
- Even minor discrepancies in binary values (e.g., a 1 instead of a 0) will result in point deductions.
3. Performance Metrics:
- Values like IPC and CPI must match expected results.
- The way you format them should be fine, but preferred using the format provided for easier auto-grading.
- Deviations may result in manual grading, which is discouraged due to added complexity.
4. File Format:
- Ensure output files (RF, DMEM) are identical to the provided format and test cases to avoid issues during grading.
